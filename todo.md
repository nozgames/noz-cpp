# Todo

- [ ] Grid is in front of meshes
- [ ] Type numbers for g when moving assets
- [ ] sort order is too unstable, causing meta files to be changed a lot
- [ ] sort is not working

- [ ] Icons for assets that have no draw function
- [ ] Make use of global asset list for asset manifest
- [ ] Adding a bone to the skeleton caused the animations to write garbage data for position
- [ ] Text not fitting in notification box
- [ ] Change frames to be boxes with dots like animator, so holds are longer boxes
- [ ] skeleton bone sort order for editor using []
- [ ] bone scale
- [ ] Bone length in the skeleton editor

- [ ] Add colliders to meshes
- [ ] Capture mouse while using tools like grab
- [ ] inserting a frame with o in the middle seems to not be working
- [ ] Change UI, vertex size, edge size, etc to not scale with the window size
- [ ] zoom should zoom in at cursor
- [ ] Animation bounds does not take into account the actual animation, just the skeleton
- [ ] x to delete assets

- [ ] moving bones in skeleton is not changing animations?
- [ ] Bone rename is not marking modified
- [ ] Prevent duplicate assets of same type and same name in different folders.
- [ ] Creating new animation had 0 frames when i tried to edit the frame, bounds seemed bad too
- [ ] moving bones in some loaded animations move weird, maybe rotation or incorrect matrcieis
- [ ] editor animation likely leaking animation and skeleton asset 
- [ ] vfx hotload broken
- [ ] new clone animation
- [ ] hold frames (h then number)
- [ ] g r to reset / r r rather than alt-g and alt-r
- [ ] Instance a skelton so we can parent different skinned meshes (sotre the instances in the meta file for the skeleton)
- [ ] Button to disable color and show grey scale
- [ ] hover on animation should play ?
- [ ] Saving an asset is causing a double import (.meta?)
- [ ] Saving an asset should suppress the import notification 
- [ ] convert props to be struct
- [ ] Need way to handle invalid assets (show invalid or error in editor, animation with missing skeleton for example)
- [ ] Animation with no frames not loading
- [ ] After creating new mesh I cannot select bones in the skeleton view
- [ ] Outline size tool
- [ ] button duplicate a frame
- [ ] button copy a frame
- [ ] button paste a frame
- [ ] Single shader!
- [ ] First time you load the shader is not loaded and it messes up, we need to handle the hotload?
- [ ] No way to see log messages anymore, we need a console window (win32 window you can open?)
- [ ] when moving bones in animation we have to recalculate the local position from the world after delta change
- [ ] New mesh has no color or edges
- [ ] Load editor assets in job
- [ ] Skeleton bounds should include the meshes
- [ ] Selecting a mesh asset should account for border in selection
- [ ] Alt-drag on asset to create instance  (draw origin in blue and outline a lighter grey)
- [ ] Set border color
- [ ] Why isnt it closing? (thread lock) (job system)
- [ ] Light color in the editor config
- [ ] Use TextInput for typing after move or scale command
- [ ] Pressing g or r should stop the previous g or r and start a new one
- [ ] button to set how hard an edge is, soft on a quad will average normals 
- [ ] Box select being pushed it making the color go away, is that ok?
- [ ] highlight colors of selected triangles in the triangle ui
- [ ] add face if 3 verts are selected and no triangle there
- [ ] single click to select asset, ctrl to toggle
- [ ] x to limit move
- [ ] y to limit move
- [ ] Trail vfx for individual particles
- [ ] vfx initial_rotation and rotation over time
- [ ] Localized strings

- [ ] combined vertex buffer for rendering so we can stream data to it like triangles?
- [ ] key to hide / show palette (alt-c?)
- [ ] Scene asset
- [ ] Scene editor
- [ ] hot load of textures
- [ ] hot load of sounds
- [ ] Something causes a spawn of error messages in the editor when client disconnects / reconnects, not sure which

- [ ] Trace a font out with meshes?
- [ ] Auto complete on commands

# Todo

- [ ] undo / redo (whole mesh)
- [ ] Selecting a vertex should select the closest vertex, not the first one it finds
- [ ] only select points, edges, faces on mouse up if there was no box select

- [ ] Save window positino as well as size
- [ ] bug with saving size, sometimes wrong size
- [ ] :n to make a new file  n <type> <name>
- [ ] Right click to change light position
- [ ] Button to disable color and show grey scale
- [ ] light options

- [ ] need way to create new points not on mesh (v, find closest edge,
- [ ] new mesh format similar to obj
- [ ] button to set how hard an edge is, soft on a quad will average normals 
- [ ] Box select being pushed it making the color go away, is that ok?
- [ ] When you add a vertex interpolate the height from the neighbors
- [ ] highlight colors of selected triangles in the triangle ui
- [ ] add face if 3 verts are selected and no triangle there
- [ ] add vert to center of triangle
- [ ] m to merge vertices (broken)
- [ ] x to dissovlve vertices, faces, edges
- [ ] q to rotate edge
- [ ] w for normal
- [ ] highlight triangle when selected
- [ ] highlight edge when selected
- [ ] single click to select asset, ctrl to toggle
- [ ] Change UI, vertex size, edge size, etc to not scale with the window size
- [ ] combined vertex buffer for rendering so we can stream data to it like triangles?  
- [ ] key to hide / show palette (c?)
- [ ] r - rotate
- [ ] e for extrude
- [ ] x to limit move
- [ ] y to limit move

- [ ] Auto complete on commands
- [ ] Job system
- [ ] Trace a font out with meshes?
- [ ] Clean importer.cpp
- [ ] check if importer.cpp is handling meta dependency and remove the code from importers
- [ ] shader include dependency handling.
- [ ] configurable outline color
- [ ] Animation / Skeletons
- [ ] Animator
- [ ] Border seems to be generating different sizes for different meshes
- [ ] Trail vfx for individual particles
- [ ] vfx initial_rotation and rotation over time
- [ ] style sheet inherit not working
- [ ] Localized strings
- [ ] hot load of textures
- [ ] hot load of sounds
- [ ] hot load of shaders
- [ ] Something causes a spawn of error messages in the editor when client disconnects / reconnects, not sure which

- [X] Auto generate names from styles and other things that have names in g_names....- [ ] Push / Pop the scratch before each asset load or NAME_*
- [X] Bug with default styles in style sheets causing width and height to not be auto
- [X] Focus gain / lost event
- [X] hot load of style sheets
- [X] hot load of vfx
- [X] separate opacity from color in vfx
- [X] ctrl + drag = snap
- [X] Move meshz to the editor (--edit to enter edit mode)
- [x] move nozed to its own repo using the noz library
- [X] edit mode on specific asset with tab
- [X] When opening asset editor open all meshes
- [X] save the world canvas position of mesh in the .meta file
- [X] hot load of meshes
- [X] g - move
- [X] Draw pivot point
- [X] s - scale
- [x] zoom limits
- [x] scaled zoom
- [x] edges and vertices not rendering correctly
- [x] multi-select of objects in the world
- [x] Notification system in the bottom right (Saving)
- [x] click on a face to select face
- [x] click on vertex to select vertex
- [x] click on edge to select edge
- [x] Ctrl-s save
- [x] Palette uv is wrong, can see left?
- [X] click detection on ui
- [X] color picker to select color
- [X] converted editable mesh to use vec3 so we can calc normals
- [X] Change palette to be 128x128 which is 256 colors at 8x8 per color
- [X] moving objects in the world should use the g key too
- [X] Clicking on a color deselects the verts because the click is making it through
- [x] hitting zero while doing height should zero it
- [X] Show a height slider centered around the click point when adjusting height
- [X] Draw a line from to the center for scale
- [X] When window closes uninit renderr and asset editor (only if window is created later)
- [X] Load asset editor when :e
- [X] if asset name is specified after :e then focus on it in editor
- [X] Text input by watching WM_CHAR in windows
- [X] Alt-tab should not trigger edit mode
- [X] : when in asset editor should allow commands to be typed in terminal (forward keys there or something?)
- [X] :s to save
- [X] outlines

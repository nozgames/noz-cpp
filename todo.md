# Todo

- [ ] single click to select asset, ctrl to toggle
- [ ] moving objects in the world should use the g key too
- [ ] Ctrl-s save
- [ ] undo / redo (whole mesh)
- [ ] m to merge vertices
- [ ] x to dissovlve vertices, faces, edges
- [ ] q to rotate edge
- [ ] Change UI, vertex size, edge size, etc to not scale with the window size
- [ ] key to hide / show palette
- [ ] Palette uv is wrong, can see left?
- [ ] r - rotate
- [ ] highlight triangle when selected
- [ ] highlight edge when selected
- [ ] combined vertex buffer for rendering so we can stream data to it like triangles?  
- [ ] e for extrude
- [ ] x to limit move 
- [ ] y to limit move
- [ ] color picker to select color
- [ ] Change palette to be 128x128 which is 256 colors at 8x8 per color

- [ ] Clean importer.cpp
- [ ] check if importer.cpp is handling meta dependency and remove the code from importers
- [ ] shader include dependency handling.
- [ ] configurable outline color
- [ ] Animation / Skeletons
- [ ] Animator
- [ ] Border seems to be generating different sizes for different meshes
- [ ] Trail vfx for individual particles
- [ ] vfx initial_rotation and rotation over time

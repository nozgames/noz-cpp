# Todo

- [ ] Play test animation in game

- [ ] skeleton editor bone rotate tool
- [ ] skeleton editor bone move tool
- [ ] skeleton editor bind mesh

- [ ] calculate normals for faces
- [ ] Save window positino as well as size
- [ ] bug with saving window size, sometimes wrong size
- [ ] Button to disable color and show grey scale
- [ ] button to set how hard an edge is, soft on a quad will average normals 
- [ ] Box select being pushed it making the color go away, is that ok?
- [ ] When you add a vertex interpolate the height from the neighbors
- [ ] highlight colors of selected triangles in the triangle ui
- [ ] add face if 3 verts are selected and no triangle there
- [ ] single click to select asset, ctrl to toggle
- [ ] Change UI, vertex size, edge size, etc to not scale with the window size
- [ ] combined vertex buffer for rendering so we can stream data to it like triangles?  
- [ ] key to hide / show palette (c?)
- [ ] e for extrude
- [ ] x to limit move
- [ ] y to limit move
- [ ] Scene asset 
- [ ] Scene editor

- [ ] Auto complete on commands
- [ ] Job system
- [ ] Trace a font out with meshes?
- [ ] shader include dependency handling.
- [ ] configurable outline color
- [ ] Trail vfx for individual particles
- [ ] vfx initial_rotation and rotation over time
- [ ] style sheet inherit not working
- [ ] Localized strings
- [ ] hot load of textures
- [ ] hot load of sounds
- [ ] Something causes a spawn of error messages in the editor when client disconnects / reconnects, not sure which
- [ ] Clean importer.cpp

- [x] Ctrl-s save
- [x] Palette uv is wrong, can see left?
- [X] click detection on ui
- [X] color picker to select color
- [X] converted editable mesh to use vec3 so we can calc normals
- [X] Change palette to be 128x128 which is 256 colors at 8x8 per color
- [X] moving objects in the world should use the g key too
- [X] Clicking on a color deselects the verts because the click is making it through
- [x] hitting zero while doing height should zero it
